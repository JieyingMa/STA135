Multivariate Data Analysis

-	Analyzed chemical and physical compositions of 600 Portuguese wines using PCA and K-means clustering to differentiate red and white wines, achieving 90.25% prediction accuracy after dimensionality reduction.
-	Applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for robust classification of wine types, demonstrating predictive proficiency with a mislabeling rate of only 0.3%.
-	Developed a multinomial logistic regression model to evaluate the impact of volatile acidity, free sulfur dioxide, and alcohol levels on wine quality, achieving 65.8% prediction accuracy.
